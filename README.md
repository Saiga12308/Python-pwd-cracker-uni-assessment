Python ver 3.10

This was a "password cracker" based on very specific password rules for a uni assessment.

This code is incredibly intensive on the cpu as it utilises multiprocessing. expect 100% cpu usage, so I would not recommend running this on a uni computer or a laptop with 50 processes. 10 or 20 is more reasonable for a lower-end cpu.
