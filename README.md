Python ver 3.10

This code is incredibly resource intensive as it utilises multiprocessing. expect 100% cpu usage and insane memory usage, so I would not recommend running this on a uni computer or a laptop with 50 processes. 10 or 20 is more reasonable for a lower-end cpu


memory usage:

20 processes = ~1.5gb  1.3gb-1.7gb

50 processes = ~4gb  3.5gb-4.3gb
